# This is a udev rule file for all devices from FTDI with VID 0x0403 (not specific to any FTDI 
# product (USB PID)). Place this file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ for Ubuntu Linux distro. These rules 
# will grant read and write access to all users, include non-privileged users, for all USB devices
# that have a matching Vendor ID according to the rules below. If required more restrictions on 
# access to these devices can be achieved. Please learn more about writing udev rules in this case.
